## Project Overview
The [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) provided a static comp for students to replicate using HTML and CSS. The goal of the project was to build something that respected the integrity of the original comp. A spec sheet for the project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/M2-static-comp-challenge.html).
